\section{Implication of results}

To recapitulate our findings thus far: First, we have been able to establish that, provided with spatial features related to population, amenity points-of-interest density and diversity, and various public transportation accessibility indices---all of which are accessible as open data--- and with spatial lag as feature, we can predict the total number of arrivals by public transport to a high degree of accuracy using a XGBoost model fine-tuned to overcome overfitting due
