\chapter*{Abstract}
Leveraging explainable machine learning techniques (SHAP) on a finetuned XGBoost model, we were able to predict with high accuracy ($R^2>80\%$) the total arrivals by public transport in an area in Greater London, representing its trip attractiveness, from its amenity and connectivity features extracted from open data. The use of global and local SHAP explanations on the model provides valuable insights into not only feature importance but also the spatial heterogeneity of these features, which can be used to identify urban activity centres as destination hotspots and inform urban and transport planning decisions. The methodology can be extended to other localities where mobility datasets are not available since it relies on open data sources such as OpenStreetMap and the national census. Furthermore, this study serves as a foundation for future urban mobility research that aims to establish a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence intracity travel demand and urban activity patterns.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I am grateful for the guidance and insightful feedback from my supervisor, Prof. Elsa Arcaute, who has helped shape the direction of my work from its inception. I am also thankful for the invaluable support from the Public Transport Service Planning team at Transport for London (TfL). Their expert opinions, guidance around using TfL data, and real-world insights into the data science behind transport planning have greatly enriched my knowledge, as well as this research project. Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and friends, old and new, for their unwavering support, encouragement and inspiration as I took a leap of faith into navigating a brand new field. Without them, this journey would not have been as fulfilling and rewarding as it has been.
