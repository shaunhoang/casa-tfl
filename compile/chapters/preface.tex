\chapter*{Abstract}
Leveraging explainable machine learning techniques (SHAP) on the predictions of a finetuned XGBoost model that has been trained on amenity and connectivity features extracted from open data, we were able to model total arrivals by public transport in an area in Greater London with high accuracy ($R^2>80\%$) which represent its 'trip attractiveness'. The use of global and local SHAP explanations on the model provides valuable insights into not only feature importance but also the spatial heterogeneity of these features, which can be used to identify urban activity centres as destination hotspots and inform urban and transport planning decisions. The methodology can be extended to other localities where mobility datasets are not available since it relies on open data sources such as OpenStreetMap and the national census. Furthermore, this study serves as a foundation for future urban mobility research that aims to establish a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence intracity travel demand and urban activity patterns.
