  abstract = {Planning of transportation facilities for any city depends on trip generation. In this paper, trip attraction rate of six shopping centers located at different places (Uttara, Gulshan and Dhanmondi) in Dhaka city is determined. Physical features like floor area (ft2), parking space, number of shops, number of entry, number of employees (per shop) are considered to determine the trip attraction rate. The number of vehicles (car) and persons entering the shopping center on weekend and weekday during peak hour for every 15 minutes time interval are counted. A similar trend showed in all the graphs between the trip rate on weekend and weekdays. In all cases, trip rate on weekend is higher than the trip rate on weekday. This data used to determine the trip attraction rate with respect to different physical features. This trip attraction rate can be used for estimating the traffic volume and evaluating the traffic impacts adjacent a new shopping center. Two regression models were also developed as a function of different physical features to estimate the trip attractions of the shopping centers. The result showed that all the physical features have a strong correlation except number of entry. This models will be helpful in estimating the trip attraction rate for any shopping centers.},

We want to explain individual predictions from such models by learning simple, interpretable explanations. Shapley value is a game theoretic concept that can be used for this purpose. The Shapley value framework has a series of desirable theoretical properties, and can in principle handle any predictive model. Kernel SHAP is a computationally efficient approximation to Shapley values in higher dimensions. Like several other existing methods, this approach assumes that the features are independent. Since Shapley values currently suffer from inclusion of unrealistic data instances when features are correlated, the explanations may be very misleading. This is the case even if a simple linear model is used for predictions. In this paper, we extend the Kernel SHAP method to handle dependent features. We provide several examples of linear and non-linear models with various degrees of feature dependence, where our method gives more accurate approximations to the true Shapley values.},

One overlooked aspect is the different sensitivities in choosing the destinations based on the trip purposes. This paper proposes a framework to calibrate a doubly-constrained gravity model for the trip distribution of the city of Alexandria based on a Household Travel Survey carried out in 2002. The trip ends are estimated from the available census data. Important parameters for the trip attraction models were estimated and validated in the course of this research. Since a small sample is used, a simple, effective weighing technique is applied to mitigate the sample bias. The purpose-based dispersion parameters are estimated based on the weighted sample. The model validation is also introduced in terms of trip length distribution, intrazonal trips and the distribution of the trip interchanges between city parts. The proposed model demonstrates the different patterns of trip distribution per purpose. It also shows a considerable shift toward non-compulsory trip purposes in the city of Alexandria.},

  abstract = {Manifold applications in transportation system engineering rely on accurate modeling of human mobility demand. This demand is often represented by so-called mobility plans. Distinguished by their levels of aggregation, activity-based and trip-based models are the most prominent types of demand models in the literature. Macroscopic trip-based models are widely available but do not model mobility at the person level. In contrast, activity-based approaches simulate mobility microscopically but are complex and thus rarely available. The goal of this article is to present, apply, and validate an approach to generate activity-based mobility plans which microscopically reproduce real-world mobility demand but circumvent the complexity of activity-based approaches. To achieve this, existing trip-based models and mobility surveys are employed. Application results for car mobility in the city of Munich show that the obtained mobility plans are realistic on both a microscopic and a macroscopic level with regard to time, space, and activities. The presented approach can thus be considered appropriate for generating activity-based mobility plans whenever the development of a full-scale activity-based demand model is infeasible.},

A concurrent study has emphasized the explorative nature of human behaviour, showing that the number of visited places grows steadily over time4–7. How to reconcile these seemingly contradicting facts remains an open question. Here, we analyse high-resolution multi-year traces of \textasciitilde 40,000 individuals from 4 datasets and show that this tension vanishes when the long-term evolution of mobility patterns is considered. We reveal that mobility patterns evolve significantly yet smoothly, and that the number of familiar locations an individual visits at any point is a conserved quantity with a typical size of \textasciitilde 25. We use this finding to improve state-of-the-art modelling of human mobility4,8. Furthermore, shifting the attention from aggregated quantities to individual behaviour, we show that the size of an individual’s set of preferred locations correlates with their number of social interactions. This result suggests a connection between the conserved quantity we identify, which as we show cannot be understood purely on the basis of time constraints, and the ‘Dunbar number’9,10 describing a cognitive upper limit to an individual’s number of social relations. We anticipate that our work will spark further research linking the study of human mobility and the cognitive and behavioural sciences.},

  abstract = {There is a contradiction at the heart of our current understanding of individual and collective mobility patterns. On the one hand, a highly influential body of literature on human mobility driven by analyses of massive empirical datasets finds that human movements show no evidence of characteristic spatial scales. There, human mobility is described as scale free1–3. On the other hand, geographically, the concept of scale—referring to meaningful levels of description from individual buildings to neighbourhoods, cities, regions and countries—is central for the description of various aspects of human behaviour, such as socioeconomic interactions, or political and cultural dynamics4,5. Here we resolve this apparent paradox by showing that day-to-day human mobility does indeed contain meaningful scales, corresponding to spatial ‘containers’ that restrict mobility behaviour. The scale-free results arise from aggregating displacements across containers. We present a simple model—which given a person’s trajectory—infers their neighbourhood, city and so on, as well as the sizes of these geographical containers. We find that the containers—characterizing the trajectories of more than 700,000 individuals—do indeed have typical sizes. We show that our model is also able to~generate highly realistic trajectories and provides a way to understand the differences in mobility behaviour across countries, gender groups and urban–rural areas.},

Here, we analyze a heavily aggregated and anonymized summary of global mobility and investigate the relationships between socioeconomic status and mobility across a hundred cities in the US and Brazil. We uncover two types of relationships, finding either a clear connection or little-to-no interdependencies. The former tend to be characterized by low levels of public transportation usage, inequitable access to basic amenities and services, and segregated clusters of communities in terms of income, with the latter class showing the opposite trends. Our findings provide useful lessons in designing urban habitats that serve the larger interests of all inhabitants irrespective of their economic status.},

Here anonymous and aggregated flows generated from three hundred million users, opted-in to Location History, are used to extract global Intra-urban trips.

These techniques are designed to be inexpensive enhancements to existing trip-based models that can be implemented quickly in a straightforward manner as part of a model update without requiring the development of a whole new model. There are many problems related to non-home-based trips in traditional trip-based models arising from the fact that they are disconnected from the home-based trips with which they comprise complete tours. The fundamental approach presented in this guide addresses these problems with a simple change to the structure of trip-based models, running non-home-based model components after and conditional on the home-based model components instead of in parallel and independently of them. This relatively simple structural change appears to significantly improve the trip-based model’s ability to represent non-home-based trips and their response to land use changes and transportation infrastructure investments.},

It then explores the challenges and issues facing such streets in British cities before turning specifically to the London case. Through a complimentary set of empirical investigations, London's local high streets are explored across two scales, in terms of their strategic city-wide contribution, and through their local impact. They are examined both with regard to their situation today and their future potential. The policy context across London is also, explored, before conclusions and recommendations are drawn out of relevance to London and to mixed street corridors across the world. Mixed streets represent a particularly ‘wicked’ problem for cities, yet, as the research shows, they are also some of the most important spaces in the city, of far greater complexity and local significance than is realised, and possessing untapped strategic growth potential.},

This paper reviews the development of "activity center" definitions from various research fields, and concludes that the application of contemporary definitions to transportation analyses has significant weaknesses, particularly in analyzing suburban agglomerations of activities. An alternative method is suggested which incor-porates not only the presence of concentrated employment, the traditional criteria, but also the trip-attracting strength of the employment types present in an activity center. The Philadelphia metropolitan area is analyzed using traditional definitions and the proposed method-ology; several areas which would not be identified using traditional definitions meet the new criteria.

  abstract = {Urban geography could be characterized by analysing the patterns that describe the flows of people and goods. Measuring urban structures is essential for supporting an evidence-based spatial planning policy. The objective of this study is to examine how the spatial–temporal distribution of public transport passenger flow could be used to reveal urban structure dynamics. A methodology to identify and classify centres based on mobility data was applied to Metropolitan Stockholm in Sweden using multi-modal public transport passenger flows. Stockholm is known for its long-term monocentric planning with a dominant central core and radial public transport system. Strategic nodes along its radial public transport system have been a focus for development of sub-centres. Although the regional planning policy embraces a shift towards a polycentric planning policy, the results indicate that this has not been realized insofar.},

  abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions —density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the ‘3Ds’ affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing ‘walking quality’ was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},

This paper focuses on urban areas of interest (UAOI), a concept that provides functional definitions of a city’s spatial structure. Traditional sources of social data can rarely capture these aspects at scale while spatial information on the city alone does not capture how the population values different parts of the city and in different ways. Hence, we leverage volunteered geographic information (VGI) to overcome some of the limits of traditional sources in providing urban structural and functional insights. We use a special type of VGI—metadata from geotagged Flickr images—to identify UAOIs and exploit their temporal and spatial attributes. To do this, we propose a methodological strategy that combines hierarchical density-based spatial clustering for applications with noise and the ‘α-shape’ algorithm to quantify the dynamics of UAOIs in Inner London for a period 2013–2015 and develop an innovative visualisation of UAOI profiles from which UAOI dynamics can be explored. Our results expand and improve upon the previous literature on this topic and provide a useful reference for urban practitioners who might wish to include more timely information when making decisions.},

  abstract = {The spatial patterns and processes of cities can be described with various entropy functions. However, spatial entropy always depends on the scale of measurement, and it is difficult to find a characteristic value for it. In contrast, fractal parameters can be employed to characterize scale-free phenomena and reflect the local features of random multi-scaling structure. This paper is devoted to exploring the similarities and differences between spatial entropy and fractal dimension in urban description. Drawing an analogy between cities and growing fractals, we illustrate the definitions of fractal dimension based on different entropy concepts. Three representative fractal dimensions in the multifractal dimension set, capacity dimension, information dimension, and correlation dimension, are utilized to make empirical analyses of the urban form of two Chinese cities, Beijing and Hangzhou. The results show that the entropy values vary with the measurement scale, but the fractal dimension value is stable is method and study area are fixed; if the linear size of boxes is small enough (e.g., {$<$}1/25), the linear correlation between entropy and fractal dimension is significant (based on the confidence level of 99\%). Further empirical analysis indicates that fractal dimension is close to the characteristic values of spatial entropy. This suggests that the physical meaning of fractal dimension can be interpreted by the ideas from entropy and scaling and the conclusion is revealing for future spatial analysis of cities.},

  abstract = {Despite rapid changes in vehicle technology and the expansion of IT-based mobility solutions, travel habits must be changed to address the environmental and health implications of increasing car dependency. A significant amount of research focuses on commuting, which comprises the largest share of annual vehicle miles travelled. However, non-work trips are also significant, especially when considering trip frequency. Using empirical data (N = 1298) from an urban-rural region and bivariate statistical analysis, the relationship between the land use–transport configuration (6 types) and travel behaviour patterns is examined for 14 non-work destinations. The land use characterisation used in this research includes an updated means of representing a land use mix. By defining the typologies of land use and transport for use in the analysis, the findings can be directed towards contrasting area types in the region. A strong statistically significant association between the land use–transport configuration and mode-share for 14 non-work journey purposes is found. Using regression modelling, income and car ownership are identified as key influences on travel behaviour patterns. The results of both analyses show that, for non-work trips, the transport–land use relationship is as important as key socio-demographic indicators. However, the results for reductions in car travel are relatively small for the area typologies outside the inner-city core. This indicates that efforts to provide alternatives to car travel in order to mitigate car dependency should be prioritised in these outer urban areas. Appropriate management of spatial structure for non-work activity types such that active mode use is possible is essential. This will resolve some of the important environmental and health impacts of car dependency.},

Computers made some of this possible, but their limited power did not allow for more than relatively small analytic explorations and consequently many of these earlier ideas are now buried in the mists of time. Here we attempt to replicate one of these early analyses using taxi flow data collected in 1962 and originally used by Goddard (1970 Goddard, J. B. 1970. Functional regions within the city centre: A study by factor analysis of taxi flows in Central London. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 49:161–82.[Crossref], [Web of Science ®] [Google Scholar]; then at the London School of Economics) to extract functional regions within London's city center. Our experiment attempts to replicate Goddard's methodology on a modern taxi flow data set, acquired through Global Positioning System tracking. We initially expected that our analysis would be directly comparable with Goddard's, potentially providing insights into temporal change in the spatial structure of the city core. Attempts at replicating the original analysis have proved enormously difficult, however, for several reasons, including the many subjective choices made by the researcher in articulating and using the original method and the specific characteristics of contemporary taxi flow data. We therefore opt to replicate Goddard's approach as closely and as logically as possible and to fill in gaps based on statistically informed choices. We have also run the analysis on two spatial scales—Central London and a wider area—to explore how scales of analyses that were beyond the capacities of Goddard's early computations also help to shape our understanding of the results he obtained.},

Unlike situation which existed two to three decades ago, trends in cities are different today. As traffic on the roads is increasing regularly, it is very important to simulate current as well as future scenario on the roads with a suitable modeling process which will eventually help in transport planning to meet future travel demand of the city. Four stage modeling (FSM) process is one such process that can be used to model travel demand for a city. In the present study, a four stage model was developed for National Capital Territory of Delhi, India to determine travel demand for the years 2014 and 2021. Household interview survey samples were used to determine the travel behavior of the trip makers and were further used to calibrate the model. The three stages of trip generation, trip distribution and trip assignment of the traditional four stage modeling process are the scope of the present study. During the assignment process, User Equilibrium, Stochastic User Equilibrium and All or Nothing traffic assignment methods were used to assign the traffic on the present road network of the city and comparison of the three assignment methods was also done.},

In this paper, we propose to adjust the STA model (by introducing a so-called PT-STA model) with three core purposes: (1) focusing on public transport accessibility specifically, (2) measuring accessibility to both fixed activities and discretionary opportunities, and (3) integrating travel-time thresholds in the accessibility measurement. These three elements aim to make the PT-STA model a suitable tool to evaluate the impacts of public transport interventions on person-based accessibility and extend the evaluation of public transport accessibility to its fixed and discretionary dimensions. The PT-STA model is tested with a sample of 118 residents of the rural municipality of Mühlwald (South Tyrol, Italy). Results show that the accessibility to fixed activities and discretionary opportunities are limitedly correlated. It is possible to identify people with high accessibility to fixed activities and poor access to discretionary opportunities (typically pensioners and homemakers living in remote locations) and vice versa (e.g. people with articulated rural–urban commutes but daily visiting locations with several amenities). These results preliminarily confirm the importance of combining both accessibility dimensions in the PT-STA model since they tell complementary and not overlapped stories that are relevant for policymakers to evaluate the pros and cons of alternative public transport interventions.},

In Australian cities transport planners still heavily rely upon complex, quantitative transport models, especially the four-step model (FSM) and its variants, used at the regional, metropolitan and corridor levels of analysis. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a detailed critique of each stage of the FSM, there are numerous problems with its use that need to be addressed. This paper examines the empirical shortfalls of the technical-rational process, highlighting the reliance on a select few experts, limited public participation in modelling processes, and decision-makers who have little understanding of the methodological limitations inherent in transport modelling advice. Model deficiencies do not allow for, and may actually impede consideration of many of the most important emerging issues within cities, including road pricing, climate change and oil vulnerability, as well as long-held concerns such as land use changes, induced travel, the environment and sustainability. This paper identifies numerous inter-related concerns about the broader policy and political dimensions of technical-rational decision-making in the transport sector, and recognises the main tools used in technical assessments.

However, drawing conclusions about a complex system from a fit, without any further knowledge of the underlying dynamics, might lead to erroneous interpretations. Here we show, on the basis of a data set describing the trajectories of 780,000 private vehicles in Italy, that the Lévy flight model cannot explain the behaviour of travel times and speeds. We therefore introduce a class of accelerated random walks, validated by empirical observations, where the velocity changes due to acceleration kicks at random times. Combining this mechanism with an exponentially decaying distribution of travel times leads to a short-tailed distribution of distances which could indeed be mistaken with a truncated power law. These results illustrate the limits of purely descriptive models and provide a mechanistic view of mobility.},

We find that in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Levy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time independent characteristic length scale and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent based modeling.},

Hence, the location of individuals' work place influences their choice of residential location because of space constraints and time requirements to reach the work place. Physical accessibility of different individuals varies according to different activity centers because people have varied home locations. This study addresses the demand-side variables to measure accessibility. The variables are individuals' purpose of activity, their travel characteristics, and time availability for the activity. An algorithm was developed that delimits the extent of area an individual will have access to for his/her activities. A spatial search, centering activity locations, was adopted to delimit the accessible area while considering available transport network. The research found the residential location of university students and teachers and out-of-town location of the universities have resulted in students having significant disadvantage in terms of their access to urban activity centers in the town. This algorithm could further be used to measure accessibility of different groups of people or of different residential clusters for single or multi-number opportunity places for transport forecasting, land use modeling, and utility service planning.},

  abstract = {Thanks to the prevalence of mobile phones and GPS devices, spatiotemporal population data can be obtained easily. In this article, we propose a mixture of collective graphical models for estimating people flow from spatiotemporal population data. The spatiotemporal population data we use as input is the number of people in each grid cell area over time, which is aggregated information about many individuals; to preserve privacy, they do not contain trajectories of each individual. Therefore, it is impossible to directly estimate people flow. To overcome this problem, the proposed model assumes that transition populations are hidden variables and estimates the hidden transition populations and transition probabilities simultaneously. The proposed model can handle changes of people flow over time by segmenting time-of-day points into multiple clusters, where different clusters have different flow patterns. We develop an efficient variational Bayesian inference procedure for the collective graphical mixture model. In our experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by using four real-world spatiotemporal population datasets in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Beijing.},

Since there is no information about individual trajectories in the aggregated data, it is not straightforward to estimate population flow. With the proposed method, we utilize a collective graphical model with which we can learn individual transition models from the aggregated data by analytically marginalizing the individual locations. Learning a spatio-temporal collective graphical model only from the aggregated data is an ill-posed problem since the number of parameters to be estimated exceeds the number of observations. The proposed method reduces the effective number of parameters by modeling the transition probabilities with a neural network that takes the locations of the origin and the destination areas and the time of day as inputs. By this modeling, we can automatically learn nonlinear spatio-temporal relationships flexibly among transitions, locations, and times. With four real-world population data sets in Japan and China, we demonstrate that the proposed method can estimate the transition population more accurately than existing methods.},

Usually trip attraction volumes are estimated based on land use characteristics. However, executing of land use-based trip attraction models are severely constrained by the lack of updated land use data in developing countries. The proposed method used network centrality-based explanatory variables as “connectivity”, “local integration” and “global integration”. Space syntax tools were used to compute the centrality of road segments. GIS-based kernel density estimation method was used to transform computed road segment-based centrality values into traffic analysis zone. Trip attraction values exhibited significant high correlation with connectivity, global and local integration values. The study developed and validated model to estimate trip attraction by using connectivity, local integration and global integration values as endogenous variables with an accepted level of accuracy (R2~{$>~$}0.75). The proposed approach required minimal data, and it was easily executed using a geographic information system. The study recommended the proposed method as a practical tool for transport planners and engineers, especially who work in developing countries and where updated land use data is unavailable.},

In this work, we analyze an activity-based travel survey conducted in the Chicago metropolitan area over a demographic representative sample of its population. Detailed data on activities by time of day were collected from more than 30,000 individuals (and 10,552 households) who participated in a 1-day or 2-day survey implemented from January 2007 to February 2008. We examine this large-scale data in order to explore three critical issues: (1) the inherent daily activity structure of individuals in a metropolitan area, (2) the variation of individual daily activities—how they grow and fade over time, and (3) clusters of individual behaviors and the revelation of their related socio-demographic information. We find that the population can be clustered into 8 and 7 representative groups according to their activities during weekdays and weekends, respectively. Our results enrich the traditional divisions consisting of only three groups (workers, students and non-workers) and provide clusters based on activities of different time of day. The generated clusters combined with social demographic information provide a new perspective for urban and transportation planning as well as for emergency response and spreading dynamics, by addressing when, where, and how individuals interact with places in metropolitan areas.},

Not much is known, however, about the set of mechanisms needed to generate complete mobility profiles if only using passive datasets with mostly sparse traces of individuals. In this study, we present a mechanistic modeling framework (TimeGeo) that effectively generates urban mobility patterns with resolution of 10 min and hundreds of meters. It ties together the inference of home and work activity locations from data, with the modeling of flexible activities (e.g., other) in space and time. The temporal choices are captured by only three features: the weekly home-based tour number, the dwell rate, and the burst rate. These combined generate for each individual: (i) stay duration of activities, (ii) number of visited locations per day, and (iii) daily mobility networks. These parameters capture how an individual deviates from the circadian rhythm of the population, and generate the wide spectrum of empirically observed mobility behaviors. The spatial choices of visited locations are modeled by a rank-based exploration and preferential return (r-EPR) mechanism that incorporates space in the EPR model. Finally, we show that a hierarchical multiplicative cascade method can measure the interaction between land use and generation of trips. In this way, urban structure is directly related to the observed distance of travels. This framework allows us to fully embrace the massive amount of individual data generated by information and communication technologies (ICTs) worldwide to comprehensively model urban mobility without travel surveys.},

The combination of specialisation and spatial concentration of economic activity in advanced economies has attracted much attention from economists and geographers. Here, we explore at what level of spatial aggregation contemporary tendencies of clustering of economic activities articulate themselves within the archetypal polycentric urban region of the Dutch Randstad. To examine this question, we look at profiles of business start-ups in the individual cities of the Randstad. Our focus is on business start-ups as they respond most directly to the changes taking place in the economic environment and especially those regarding the supply of labour. Our findings point to the direction of cluster formation at a supraurban level. The profiles of business start-ups are clearly converging. A process of intraregional—i.e. at the level of the polycentric urban region— homogenisation with respect to new economic activities is taking place. Within the Randstad, notably a decreasing divide between a north wing and a south wing is revealed.}

Fitting statistical models, we validate our data and find that human movement laws apply at 10 times shorter distances and movement declines 40\% more rapidly in low-income settings.

  abstract = {Trip distribution laws are basic for the travel demand characterization needed in transport and urban planning. Several approaches have been considered in the last years. One of them is the so-called gravity law, in which the number of trips is assumed to be related to the population at origin and destination and to decrease with the distance. The mathematical expression of this law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its name. Another popular approach is inspired by the theory of intervening opportunities which argues that the distance has no effect on the destination choice, playing only the role of a surrogate for the number of intervening opportunities between them. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison between these two approaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by testing them against empirical trip data at different scales and coming from different countries. Different versions of the gravity and the intervening opportunities laws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to estimate the probability that an individual has to commute from one unit to another, called trip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution laws, the commuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution models. We show that the gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities laws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure of the network and to fit the commuting distance distribution although it fails at predicting commuting flows at large distances. Finally, we show that the different approaches can be used in the absence of detailed data for calibration since their only parameter depends only on the scale of the geographic unit.},

In this paper, in order to explore the origin of the exponential law, we propose a new model which can predict individual flows in urban areas better. Based on the model, we explain the exponential law of intra-urban mobility as a result of the exponential decrease in average population density in urban areas. Indeed, both empirical and analytical results indicate that the trip length and the population density share the same exponential decaying rate.},

In this paper, we use SHAP to interpret XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) as an example to demonstrate how to extract spatial effects from machine learning models. We conduct simulation experiments that compare SHAP-explained XGBoost to Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and Multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) at the parameter level. Results show that XGBoost estimates similar spatial effects as those in SLM and MGWR models. An empirical example of Chicago ride-hailing modelling is presented to demonstrate the utility of SHAP with real datasets. Examples and evidence in this paper suggest that locally interpreted machine learning models are good alternatives to spatial statistical models and perform better when complex spatial and non-spatial effects (e.g. non-linearities, interactions) co-exist and are unknown.},

Along with the expansion, several problems, such as excessive loss of prime agricultural land and increasing traffic congestion have arisen. Thus, understanding and measurements of the expansion scale and its speed are crucial to planners and officials during urban planning and management processes. To measure such geographic phenomena, Shannon first devised entropy theory, and then Batty developed it into spatial entropy. The recently developed spatial entropy model, which was used to measure urban sprawl, introduced area to represent spatial asymmetry. However, most models did not consider spatial discretization, particularly the impact of distance. This study attempted to construct an integrated gravity-spatial entropy model to delineate distance and spatial diffusion impacts on population distribution. Then, we tested the model using Shanghai’s temporal land use and community statistical data. Application results for the new gravity-spatial model show that it is a useful tool for identifying spatial and temporal variations of urban sprawl. © 2015 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg}

Here we present an approach that accounts for spatial autocorrelation by introducing spatial features to the models. In particular, we explore two types of spatial features, namely spatial lag and eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF). These features are used within the widely used random forest (RF) method, and their effect is illustrated on two public datasets of varying sizes (Meuse and California housing datasets). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is used to determine the best subset of spatial features, and nested cross-validation is used for hyper-parameter tuning and performance evaluation. We utilize Moran’s I and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) to assess how spatial autocorrelation is captured at both global and local scales. Our results show that RF models combined with either spatial lag or ESF features yield lower errors (up to 33\% different) and reduce the global spatial autocorrelation of the residuals (up to 95\% decrease in Moran’s I) compared to the RF model with no spatial features. The local autocorrelation patterns of the residuals are weakened as well. Compared to benchmark geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, the RF models with spatial features yielded more accurate models with similar levels of global and local autocorrelation in the prediction residuals. This study reveals the effectiveness of spatial features in capturing spatial autocorrelation and provides a generic machine-learning modelling workflow for spatial prediction.},

  abstract = {Predicting commuting flows based on infrastructure and land-use information is critical for urban planning and public policy development. However, it is a challenging task given the complex patterns of commuting flows. Conventional models, such as gravity model, are mainly derived from physics principles and limited by their predictive power in real-world scenarios where many factors need to be considered. Meanwhile, most existing machine learning-based methods ignore the spatial correlations and fail to model the influence of nearby regions. To address these issues, we propose Geo-contextual Multitask Embedding Learner (GMEL), a model that captures the spatial correlations from geographic contextual information for commuting flow prediction. Specifically, we first construct a geo-adjacency network containing the geographic contextual information. Then, an attention mechanism is proposed based on the framework of graph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial correlations and encode geographic contextual information to embedding space. Two separate GATs are used to model supply and demand characteristics. A multitask learning framework is used to introduce stronger restrictions and enhance the effectiveness of the embedding representation. Finally, a gradient boosting machine is trained based on the learned embeddings to predict commuting flows. We evaluate our model using real-world datasets from New York City and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal against the state of the art.},

  abstract = {Harnessing a unique data source – longitudinal travel smartcard data linked to passenger demographics from 2019 to 2022 – we use methods of survival analysis to model the recovery of public transport patronage among 183,891 senior citizens resident in the West Midlands metropolitan region in the United Kingdom. Comparing pre and peri-pandemic patronage, we identify pronounced social and spatial inequalities in the speed of return to public transport. We find that male, younger and non-White passengers are more likely to return to public transport as soon as movement restrictions were lifted, whereas passengers from White ethnic background and affluent areas do not return to public transport within the first year after the outbreak. Pronounced social inequalities persist into the middle of 2021, and only thence they began to attenuate as part of a wider return to public transport among passengers post retirement age. In 2022, 80\% of these passengers have returned to public transport but the frequency of use has remained lower than prior to the pandemic. We discuss implications for transport policy and planning.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models are becoming increasingly complex. In fact, a sophisticated model (XGBoost boosting or deep learning) generally leads to more accurate predictions than a simple model (linear regression or decision tree). There is therefore a trade-off between the performance of a model and its interpretability: what a model gains in performance, it loses in interpretability (and vice versa), where interpretability is the ability for a human to understand the reasons for a model's decision. However, explaining the predictions made by machine learning models aims at computing and interpreting the importance of features. To achieve this, game theory has recently gained attention for better understanding the similarity between group members. In this paper, we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which is a method based on cooperative game theory, to analyze and evaluate the properties of each group. More importantly, we rely k-means PCA and Light gbm classifier to improve the data preparation before grouping the features into multiple clusters. The simulation results prove the importance of shapley value in creating an accurate and meaningful representation of each cluster.},

Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model’s performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

This combination enables us to explore the demand and market effects of relative travel times and other non-monetary PT quality factors. Our main finding is that high PT shares require that all of the studied factors; efficient travel times, direct routes or few transfers, and high service frequency is in place. If either one of these are not in place, the market share for PT is significantly reduced. The study contributes to the literature on transport mode choice by combining travel characteristics with revealed mode choice data, and showing how the relative travel time and other service attributes affect the choice of PT over car on commute trips.},

According to data such as the number of people entering and leaving each station of the Beijing Metro, the line to which the station belongs, and whether it is a transfer station by period. We selected a total of 52-time variables to participate in the PCA analysis and finally got two principal components and named them principal component 1 and principal component 2. Subsequently, we clustered the Principal Component 1 and Principal Component 2 scores of 310 sites and the latitude and longitude of the sites in k-means clustering. According to the elbow method and the contour coefficient, the final clustering results into five clusters are classified. The five clusters of stations have strong regional characteristics, and the stations of each type are more concentrated. The results of principal component analysis and cluster analysis have passed the test and have good convincing power. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the two categories with the most stations. Cluster 4 contains the largest number of stations, located in the core area of Beijing's urban area, and the passenger flow is significantly higher than other areas. Cluster 1 contains the second largest number of stations, mainly including Fengtai District. The region's economy is underdeveloped, the passenger flow is small, and there are peak and trough periods. This paper performs cluster analysis on high-dimensional data. The principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimension of high-dimensional data and retain the time and space dimensions required for clustering. The final result was in line with expectations. It is improved the shortcomings of k-means clustering for high-dimensional data. This article analyzes the daily passenger flow in Beijing, and the analysis results may be random. In the subsequent analysis, more data can be added to make the analysis more accurate.},

The proposed algorithm presents a new methodology for TAZ design based on a smoothed density surface of geocoded travel demand data. The algorithm aims to minimise the loss of information when moving from a continuous representation of the origin and destination of each trip to their discrete representations through zones, and focuses on the trade-off between the statistical precision, geographical error, and the percentage of intra-zonal trips of the resulting OD matrix. The results for the Lisbon Metropolitan Area case study suggest a significant improvement in OD matrix estimates compared to current transportation analysis practises based on administrative units.},

The first step to planning and improving proximity to services is to estimate the number of trips being made from different parts of a city. A challenge has been representative data available for that purpose. Relying on expensive and infrequently collected travel surveys for modeling trip distributions to facilities has slowed down the decision-making process. The growing abundance of data already collected, if analyzed with the right methods, can help us with planning and understanding cities. In this chapter, we examine human mobility patterns extracted from data passively collected. We present results on the use of points of interest (POIs) registered on Google Places to approximate trip attraction in a city. We compare the result of trip distribution models that utilize only POIs with those utilizing conventional data sets, based on surveys. We show that an extended radiation model provides very good estimates when compared with the official origin–destination matrices from the latest census in Mexico City.},

  abstract = {A number of techniques have been proposed to explain a machine learning model's prediction by attributing it to the corresponding input features. Popular among these are techniques that apply the Shapley value method from cooperative game theory. While existing papers focus on the axiomatic motivation of Shapley values, and efficient techniques for computing them, they offer little justification for the game formulations used, and do not address the uncertainty implicit in their methods' outputs. For instance, the popular SHAP algorithm's formulation may give substantial attributions to features that play no role in the model. In this work, we illustrate how subtle differences in the underlying game formulations of existing methods can cause large differences in the attributions for a prediction. We then present a general game formulation that unifies existing methods, and enables straightforward confidence intervals on their attributions. Furthermore, it allows us to interpret the attributions as contrastive explanations of an input relative to a distribution of reference inputs. We tie this idea to classic research in cognitive psychology on contrastive explanations, and propose a conceptual framework for generating and interpreting explanations for ML models, called formulate, approximate, explain (FAE). We apply this framework to explain black-box models trained on two UCI datasets and a Lending Club dataset.},

The analysis of this study has two parts. Firstly, an isochrone-based measure of accessibility was used for an accessibility modelling across the Perth Metropolitan Area in Western Australia. Secondly, using six node-place based indicators, this paper also endeavoured to prioritise the geographic units that are already better served by public transport, as indicated by the accessibility analysis. Multi-criteria weighed scoring method was applied to calculate a score out of 100 for each of the geographic units. The results of this analysis could help to identify activity centre(s) and other areas in Perth, if any, with higher potentials of being a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) supportive activity centre.},

  abstract = {The impact of micro-level people’s activities on urban macro-level indicators is a complex question that has been the subject of much interest among researchers and policymakers. Transportation preferences, consumption habits, communication patterns and other individual-level activities can significantly impact large-scale urban characteristics, such as the potential for innovation generation of the city. Conversely, large-scale urban characteristics can also constrain and determine the activities of their inhabitants. Therefore, understanding the interdependence and mutual reinforcement between micro- and macro-level factors is critical to defining effective public policies. The increasing availability of digital data sources, such as social media and mobile phones, has opened up new opportunities for the quantitative study of this interdependency. This paper aims to detect meaningful city clusters on the basis of a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal activity patterns for each city. The study is carried out on a worldwide city dataset of spatiotemporal activity patterns obtained from geotagged social media data. Clustering features are obtained from unsupervised topic analyses of activity patterns. Our study compares state-of-the-art clustering models, selecting the model achieving a 2.7\% greater Silhouette Score than the next-best model. Three well-separated city clusters are identified. Additionally, the study of the distribution of the City Innovation Index over these three city clusters shows discrimination of low performing from high performing cities relative to innovation. Low performing cities are identified in one well-separated cluster. Therefore, it is possible to correlate micro-scale individual-level activities to large-scale urban characteristics.},

  abstract = {Demand modeling is an important part of the setup of a traffic model for a city. All travel demand models rely on land use data as the demand for traveling fundamentally stems from activities occurring at different locations; however, many cities lack these data, or experience in estimating travel demand in their region. In response, this study develops a methodology for generating highly detailed land use data in the form of points of interest (POIs) specifically aimed at travel demand estimation purposes. The framework includes a procedure to extract, clean, enhance, and categorize freely available land use data from OpenStreetMap~(OSM) into different POI categories, such as residences, schools, and shops. These residential and activity POIs, which are typical origins and/or destinations of trips, serve as the starting point for estimating travel demand. This paper demonstrates the framework’s utility through three case studies across different cities in Belgium. It validates the effectiveness of OSM-derived POIs for travel demand estimation by replicating Antwerp’s existing demand model, examines the POIs classification’s suitability for various travel demand purposes in Leuven, and assesses the transferability of correlations between OSM data and travel demand from Antwerp to Ghent. Beyond the applications illustrated in this paper, the framework provides opportunities for future research on the consistent disaggregation of existing zonal demand estimates and design-based research in which future demand is estimated given the development of POIs. The framework is openly available as a Python tool called Poidpy.},

  abstract = {The advent of geographic online social networks such as Foursquare, where users voluntarily signal their current location, opens the door to powerful studies on human movement. In particular the fine granularity of the location data, with GPS accuracy down to 10 meters, and the worldwide scale of Foursquare adoption are unprecedented. In this paper we study urban mobility patterns of people in several metropolitan cities around the globe by analyzing a large set of Foursquare users. Surprisingly, while there are variations in human movement in different cities, our analysis shows that those are predominantly due to different distributions of places across different urban environments. Moreover, a universal law for human mobility is identified, which isolates as a key component the rank-distance, factoring in the number of places between origin and destination, rather than pure physical distance, as considered in some previous works. Building on our findings, we also show how a rank-based movement model accurately captures real human movements in different cities.},

  abstract = {Introduction Globally, there has been a recent resurgence in planning policies focused on local living (such as the 20-min neighbourhood) with proposed benefits of creating sustainable and healthy places. The policies aim to provide improved spatial access to local amenities within short walkable distances of home to encourage walking and cycling and discourage car use, however these pathways have not been examined. This study aimed to quantify the density and diversity of local amenities and their association with daily/weekly travel behaviours. Methods We used data from Understanding Society, a national panel survey of UK adults. Spatial data were used to quantify the number and diversity of amenities that have previously been associated with active travel and focused on in 20-min neighbourhood policies within small geographical areas across the UK. These were linked to individual-level data describing daily and weekly travel behaviour for: walking (at least 10-min), cycling, car and bus use. Logistic regression models measured the association between individual amenities, their diversity and daily/weekly travel, whilst controlling for individual factors such as age, sex and employment, residing in a retail centre, as well as area-level urbanicity and deprivation. Results Our analysis revealed variations in active travel and car usage patterns by sex, employment status, urbanicity, and area-level deprivation. Local amenities were associated with daily travel behaviours with more amenities generally associated with more frequent walking and less regular bus and car travel. Furthermore, increased amenity diversity was associated with reduced daily car use (OR: 0.77, p~{$<~$}0.001). Similar patterns were apparent for weekly travel outcomes. Conclusions Both access to specific local amenities as well as their diversity are both important neighbourhood factors for achieving shifts from motorised to active transport modes. Policy makers and planners need to ensure the diversity of local amenities are included in local living policies.},

The retailing centres of five UK case study cities, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Hull, Liverpool, and Nottingham, are examined over a twenty-year period using original databases on property use and geospatial mapping techniques to employ property use richness and diversity metrics in a novel manner. Overall, the analysis finds property use richness has generally risen as comparison retailing and financial services have contracted, to be replaced by hospitality, leisure, and residential uses. However, this re-balancing has not been even across retailing centres and is outstripped by rising vacancies. The study also reveals spatial variation in change of use and use diversity and richness as retailing centres slowly adapt, implying that future policymaking should focus on creating more resilient, mixed use city centres as an alternative to the single use retail high streets of the past.},

  abstract = {The generation of realistic spatio-temporal trajectories of human mobility is of fundamental importance in a wide range of applications, such as the developing of protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks or what-if analysis in urban ecosystems. Current generative algorithms fail in accurately reproducing the individuals' recurrent schedules and at the same time in accounting for the possibility that individuals may break the routine during periods of variable duration. In this article we present DITRAS (DIary-based TRAjectory Simulator), a framework to simulate the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility. DITRAS operates in two steps: the generation of a mobility diary and the translation of the mobility diary into a mobility trajectory. We propose a data-driven algorithm which constructs a diary generator from real data, capturing the tendency of individuals to follow or break their routine. We also propose a trajectory generator based on the concept of preferential exploration and preferential return. We instantiate DITRAS with the proposed diary and trajectory generators and compare the resulting algorithm with real data and synthetic data produced by other generative algorithms, built by instantiating DITRAS with several combinations of diary and trajectory generators. We show that the proposed algorithm reproduces the statistical properties of real trajectories in the most accurate way, making a step forward the understanding of the origin of the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility.},

In particular, numerous recent studies have lead to an unexpected consensus: the considerable variability in the characteristic travelled distance of individuals coexists with a high degree of predictability of their future locations. Here we shed light on this surprising coexistence by systematically investigating the impact of recurrent mobility on the characteristic distance travelled by individuals. Using both mobile phone and GPS data, we discover the existence of two distinct classes of individuals: returners and explorers. As existing models of human mobility cannot explain the existence of these two classes, we develop more realistic models able to capture the empirical findings. Finally, we show that returners and explorers play a distinct quantifiable role in spreading phenomena and that a correlation exists between their mobility patterns and social interactions.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed the emergence of massive mobility data sets, such as tracks generated by GPS devices, call detail records, and geo-tagged posts from social media platforms. These data sets have fostered a vast scientific production on various applications of mobility analysis, ranging from computational epidemiology to urban planning and transportation engineering. A strand of literature addresses data cleaning issues related to raw spatiotemporal trajectories, while the second line of research focuses on discovering the statistical "laws" that govern human movements. A significant effort has also been put on designing algorithms to generate synthetic trajectories able to reproduce, realistically, the laws of human mobility. Last but not least, a line of research addresses the crucial problem of privacy, proposing techniques to perform the re-identification of individuals in a database. A view on state of the art cannot avoid noticing that there is no statistical software that can support scientists and practitioners with all the aspects mentioned above of mobility data analysis. In this paper, we propose scikit-mobility, a Python library that has the ambition of providing an environment to reproduce existing research, analyze mobility data, and simulate human mobility habits. scikit-mobility is efficient and easy to use as it extends pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis. Moreover, scikit-mobility provides the user with many functionalities, from visualizing trajectories to generating synthetic data, from analyzing statistical patterns to assessing the privacy risk related to the analysis of mobility data sets.},

This potential has fueled, in the last few years, a growing interest around the usage of Big Data to support official statistics in the measurement of individual and collective economic well-being. In this work we study the relations between human mobility patterns and socioeconomic development. Starting from nationwide mobile phone data we extract a measure of mobility volume and a measure of mobility diversity for each individual. We then aggregate the mobility measures at municipality level and investigate the correlations with external socioeconomic indicators independently surveyed by an official statistics institute. We find three main results. First, aggregated human mobility patterns are correlated with these socioeconomic indicators. Second, the diversity of mobility, defined in terms of entropy of the individual users' trajectories, exhibits the strongest correlation with the external socioeconomic indicators. Third, the volume of mobility and the diversity of mobility show opposite correlations with the socioeconomic indicators. Our results, validated against a null model, open an interesting perspective to study human behavior through Big Data by means of new statistical indicators that quantify and possibly " nowcast " the socioeconomic development of our society.},

These comparisons always aim at measuring the accuracy with which the models reproduce the mobility described by origin–destination matrices. This has been done at different spatial scales using different datasets, and several versions of the models have been proposed to adjust to various spatial systems. However, the models, to our knowledge, have never been compared with respect to policy testing scenarios. For this reason, here we use the models to analyse the impact of the introduction of a new transportation network, a bus rapid transport system, in the city of Teresina in Brazil. We do this by measuring the estimated variation in the trip distribution, and formulate an accessibility to employment indicator for the different zones of the city. By comparing the results obtained with the two approaches, we are able to not only better assess the goodness of fit and the impact of this intervention, but also understand reasons for the systematic similarities and differences in their predictions.},

  abstract = {Population flow data (traffic sets of crowds from one regions to another) is of great value in a wide range of fields from urban traffic resource allocation to public security protection. Since the data of the individual-level mobility requires privacy protection, it's hard to collect detailed population flow data. There have been published works on generating population flow from aggregated data. But they have the limitations of considering the flow between neighbors only or modeling the mapping from aggregated population data to flow by a simple physical model without taking regionally diversity into account. However, long-range dependencies and regionally diversity is very important. Since population flow contains more information than that in aggregated population variation, generating the detailed former from the aggregated latter is quite difficult. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end structure deep learning based model to generate population flow from aggregated historical population variation data. We use real-world datasets to compare the performance of our model with several baselines, which shows the superiority of our model. This proves the potential of using deep learning in population flow generation.},

We show that patterns of intraurban movement are strongly heterogeneous in terms of volume, but not in terms of distance travelled, and that there is a polycentric structure composed of large flows organized around a limited number of activity centers. For smaller flows, the pattern of connections becomes richer and more complex and is not strictly hierarchical since it mixes different levels consisting of different orders of magnitude. This new understanding can shed light on the impact of new urban projects on the evolution of the polycentric configuration of a city and the dense structure of its centers and it provides an initial approach to modeling flows in an urban system.},

  abstract = {A fair distribution of accessibility to key activities is a central concern for distributive justice in transport planning. This implies that disparities in accessibility and the negative effects associated with a lack of accessibility should be mitigated. However, even though accessibility is not purely spatial or static, it is conventionally treated as if it were. Several studies have significantly advanced the spatio-temporal representation of accessibility. However, there is still a lack of focus on how these dynamics affect different groups of people with differing socio-economic and demographic characteristics and how these dynamics might influence their travel mode choice. The aim of this paper is to analyse how differences in accessibility to the workplace by public transport during multiple times of the day are associated with the time period in which different groups of people commute to work, and how the flexibility of individuals' time constraints might influence whether they can and do commute using public transport. Using a transport justice-focused time geography perspective, this study draws on the spatio-temporal aspects of people's real activities based on travel survey data for the Stockholm Region. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting the differences in accessibility to the workplace by public transport across multiple departure time periods; showing how these results compare with mode choice (if there is a choice); and revealing which socio-economic, demographic and geographical factors characterise these differences. This study also illustrates how a transport justice-focused time geography approach could help researchers have a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the relationship between accessibility and sustainable travel behaviour, and how this relationship might change at different times of the day.},

  abstract = {p{$>$}Traffic data plays an essential role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and offers numerous advantages, including efficient traffic control and system performance improvement. However, due to the scarcity of data collection systems, missing data in traffic datasets is inevitable. Therefore, traffic data imputation becomes an essential task. Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a type of neural network that operates on graph-structured data and has shown potential in handling traffic network related tasks such as traffic prediction and traffic data imputation. In this paper, we contribute to the body of knowledge with two aspects. First, we focus on traffic data imputation using solely spatial information. Most of the studies in the literature address spatio-temporal traffic data imputation, which is a distinct task from our research. Second, Since most GNN models operates on node features, we propose an approach to construct node features for nodes in traffic networks, by leveraging available link flows. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we implement two missing scenarios, random missing (RM) and block missing (BM). We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on three different sized real-world networks: Sioux Falls, Anaheim, and Chicago. The evaluation results demonstrate that GNN models outperform other baselines for most of the missing patterns.},

  abstract = {The significance of tourism in the globe today is enormous since it is a major source of income and jobs for a nation. Tourists are facing a range of difficulties as they select suitable tours, consisting of several itineraries in terms of their interests and distinct constraints. An itinerary consists of many Points of Interest (POIs) and a POI can further be splitted into several attractions which are named as POI within POI. For selecting the itinerary, the existing techniques use the characteristics of POIs. However, a POI consists of many attractions. Out of these, one dominating attraction’s type is considered as POI type. This ignores the other type of attraction’s present in that POI. It may cause improper selection of itineraries. Therefore, selection of itineraries by considering POI within POI is of great benefit. But, it is very challenging. For this task, we suggest an algorithm called PWP. It recommends multiple itineraries that are based on the interest of visitors, popularity of itineraries and the cost of itineraries. If a tourist wants to visit unknown areas, the PWP algorithm can be expanded further. We have taken the similar user’s features to advise multiple itineraries using the Flickr dataset. The findings show that the proposed PWP algorithm out-performs the baseline algorithms in terms of real-life matrices and heuristic based metrics.},

  abstract = {The movements of individuals within and among cities influence key aspects of our society, such as the objective and subjective well-being, the diffusion of innovations, the spreading of epidemics, and the quality of the environment. For this reason, there is increasing interest around the challenging problem of flow generation, which consists in generating the flows between a set of geographic locations, given the characteristics of the locations and without any information about the real flows. Existing solutions to flow generation are mainly based on mechanistic approaches, such as the gravity model and the radiation model, which suffer from underfitting and overdispersion, neglect important variables such as land use and the transportation network, and cannot describe non-linear relationships between these variables. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Feature Deep Gravity (MFDG) model as an effective solution to flow generation. On the one hand, the MFDG model exploits a large number of variables (e.g., characteristics of land use and the road network; transport, food, and health facilities) extracted from voluntary geographic information data (OpenStreetMap). On the other hand, our model exploits deep neural networks to describe complex non-linear relationships between those variables. Our experiments, conducted on commuting flows in England, show that the MFDG model achieves a significant increase in the performance (up to 250\textbackslash\% for highly populated areas) than mechanistic models that do not use deep neural networks, or that do not exploit geographic voluntary data. Our work presents a precise definition of the flow generation problem, which is a novel task for the deep learning community working with spatio-temporal data, and proposes a deep neural network model that significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art statistical models.},

Our experiments, conducted on mobility flows in England, Italy, and New York State, show that Deep Gravity achieves a significant increase in performance, especially in densely populated regions of interest, with respect to the classic gravity model and models that do not use deep neural networks or geographic data. Deep Gravity has good generalization capability, generating realistic flows also for geographic areas for which there is no data availability for training. Finally, we show how flows generated by Deep Gravity may be explained in terms of the geographic features and highlight crucial differences among the three considered countries interpreting the model’s prediction with explainable AI techniques.},

The use of the Shapley value is justified by citing the uniqueness result from~\textbackslash cite\{Shapley53\}, which shows that it is the only method that satisfies certain good properties (\textbackslash emph\{axioms\}). There are, however, a multiplicity of ways in which the Shapley value is operationalized for model explanation. These differ in how they reference the model, the training data, and the explanation context. Hence they differ in output, rendering the uniqueness result inapplicable. Furthermore, the techniques that rely on they training data produce non-intuitive attributions, for instance unused features can still receive attribution. In this paper, we use the axiomatic approach to study the differences between some of the many operationalizations of the Shapley value for attribution. We discuss a technique called Baseline Shapley (BShap), provide a proper uniqueness result for it, and contrast it with two other techniques from prior literature, Integrated Gradients~\textbackslash cite\{STY17\} and Conditional Expectation Shapley~\textbackslash cite\{Lundberg2017AUA\}.},

Since the location information of people is often aggregated for protecting privacy, it is not straightforward to estimate transition populations between locations from aggregated data. Here, aggregated data are incoming and outgoing people counts at each location; they do not contain tracking information of individuals. This paper proposes a probabilistic model for estimating unobserved transition populations between locations from only aggregated data. With the proposed model, temporal dynamics of people flows are assumed to be probabilistic diffusion processes over a network, where nodes are locations and edges are paths between locations. By maximizing the likelihood with flow conservation constraints that incorporate travel duration distributions between locations, our model can robustly estimate transition populations between locations. The statistically significant improvement of our model is demonstrated using real-world datasets of pedestrian data in exhibition halls, bike trip data and taxi trip data in New York City.},

  abstract = {The rapid adoption of wireless sensor devices has made it easier to record location information of people in a variety of spaces (e.g., exhibition halls). Location information is often aggregated due to privacy and/or cost concerns. The aggregated data we use as input consist of the numbers of incoming and outgoing people at each location and at each time step. Since the aggregated data lack tracking information of individuals, determining the flow of people between locations is not straightforward. In this article, we address the problem of inferring latent people flows, that is, transition populations between locations, from just aggregated population data gathered from observed locations. Existing models assume that everyone is always in one of the observed locations at every time step; this, however, is an unrealistic assumption, because we do not always have a large enough number of sensor devices to cover the large-scale spaces targeted. To overcome this drawback, we propose a probabilistic model with flow conservation constraints that incorporate travel duration distributions between observed locations. To handle noisy settings, we adopt noisy observation models for the numbers of incoming and outgoing people, where the noise is regarded as a factor that may disturb flow conservation, e.g., people may appear in or disappear from the predefined space of interest. We develop an approximate expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that simultaneously estimates transition populations and model parameters. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on real-world datasets of pedestrian data in exhibition halls, bike trip data and taxi trip data in New York City.},

  abstract = {The design of urban clusters has played an important role in urban planning, but realizing the construction of these urban plans is quite a long process. Hence, how the progress is evaluated is significant for urban managers in the process of urban construction. Traditional methods for detecting urban clusters are inaccurate since the raw data is generally collected from small sample questionnaires of resident trips rather than large-scale studies. Spatiotemporal big data provides a new lens for understanding urban clusters in a natural and fine-grained way. In this article, we propose a novel method for Detecting and Evaluating Urban Clusters (DEUC) with taxi trajectories and Sina Weibo check-in data. Firstly, DEUC applies an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method to detect urban clusters based on the similarities in the daily travel space of urban residents. Secondly, DEUC infers resident demands for land-use functions using a naïve Bayes’ theorem, and three indicators are adopted to assess the rationality of land-use functions in the detected clusters—namely, cross-regional travel index, commuting direction index, and fulfilled demand index. Thirdly, DEUC evaluates the progress of urban cluster construction by calculating a proposed conformance indicator. In the case study, we applied our method to detect and analyze urban clusters in Wuhan, China in the years 2009, 2014, and 2015. The results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can provide a scientific basis for urban construction.},

  abstract = {The classical gravity model assumes the knowledge of origin-destination (OD) flows between places. While this is reasonable for some modes of transportation such as air travel, it presents challenges to many other applications such as road travel where the observed flow on road segments, such as annual average daily traffic (AADT), may involve traffic for multiple OD pairs. This article introduces a methodology to calibrate a cumulative gravity model on a scale-specific road network. The model infers the traffic on OD pairs from the knowledge of link flows and we document its effectiveness in predicting the bidirectional volume of traffic on highways in the United States. Census data and state AADT were used to calibrate both the noncumulative and cumulative gravity models in three different regions in the western US: Arizona only, 10 western US states, and 16 western US states. The road networks were built by defining nodes as population centers of {$>$}10,000 inhabitants for Arizona and {$>$}500,000 for the other two networks. A systematic method to remove junction nodes that do not satisfy population threshold requirements but are necessary to maintain network connectivity is presented. The cumulative gravity model performed better (with a R-squared value of 0.93 in Arizona) than the standard model, but the improvement, based on two goodness-of-fit metrics (Common Part of Commuters and least squares) was above 2\% only in the Arizona network. Removal of commercial traffic from the data further improved the model's calibration in the 10-state network. A thresholding method that connects the cumulative to the standard gravity model reveals that most road trips in Arizona are within the 150-mile range and that this distance increases to 500\,miles in both western networks. Potential future applications of the present work are discussed.},

The framework disaggregates travel data to a coordinates level while considering the privacy of travelers and generates daily activity schedules based on aggregated location data from survey respondents. Moreover, the study assigns labels to travelers based on their spatial and temporal flexibility to determine their preferences for performing activities. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate sufficiently accurate activity schedules using open-source data and can be used as input to activity-based transport simulations that apply optimization approaches.}

To explore the strengths and limitations of these techniques, we studied their parametric sensitivity under different conditions, considering the spatial resolution, granularity of representation, and the number of descriptive attributes, among other relevant factors. To validate the methods, we asked residents of Santiago, Chile, to respond to a survey comparing city clustering solutions produced using the different methods. Our study shows that DMON is slightly preferred over GMM and that social features seem to be the most important ones to cluster urban areas.},

This study makes the best of Geographically Weighted Random Forest (GW-RF) model to explore the local associations between crash frequency and various influencing factors in the US, including road network attributes, socio-economic characteristics, and land use factors collected from multiple data sources. Special emphasis is put on modeling the spatial heterogeneity in the effects of a factor on crash frequency in different geographical areas in a data-driven way. The GW-RF model outperforms global models (e.g. Random Forest) and conventional geographically weighted regression, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and elucidating spatial variations. The GW-RF model reveals spatial distinctions in the effects of certain factors on crash frequency. For example, the importance of intersection density varies significantly across regions, with high significance in the southern and northeastern areas. Low-grade road density emerges as influential in specific cities. The findings highlight the significance of different factors in influencing crash frequency across zones. Road network factors, particularly intersection density, exhibit high importance universally, while socioeconomic variables demonstrate moderate effects.

  abstract = {Accurately identifying the boundary of urban clusters is a crucial aspect of studying the development of urban agglomerations. This process is essential for comprehending and optimizing smart and compact urban development. Existing studies often rely on a single category of data, which can result in coarse identification boundaries, insufficient detail accuracy, and slight discrepancies between the coverage and the actual conditions. To accurately identify the extent of urban clusters, this study proposes and compares the results of three methods for identifying dense urban areas of three major agglomerations in China: Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area. The study then integrates the results of these methods to obtain a more effective identification approach. The social economic method involved extracting a density threshold based on the fused nuclear density of socio-economic vitality data, including population, GDP, and POI, while the remote sensing method evaluated feature indices based on remote sensing images, including the density index, continuity index, gradient index, and development index. The traffic network method utilizes land transportation networks and travelling speeds to identify the minimum cost path and delineate the boundary by 20–30 min isochronous circles. The results obtained from the three methods were combined, and hotspots were identified using GIS overlay analysis and spatial autocorrelation analysis. This method integrates the multi-layered information from the previous three methods, which more comprehensively reflects the characteristics and morphology of urban clusters. Finally, the accuracy of each identification result is verified and compared. The results reveal that the average overall accuracy (OA) of the three areas delineated by the first three methods are 57.49\%, 30.88\%, and 33.74\%, respectively. Furthermore, the average Kappa coefficients of these areas are 0.4795, 0.2609, and 0.2770, respectively. After performing data fusion, the resulting average overall accuracy (OA) was 85.34\%, and the average Kappa coefficient was 0.7394. These findings suggest that the data fusion method can effectively delineate dense urban areas with greater accuracy than the previous three methods. Additionally, this method can accurately reflect the scope of urban clusters by depicting their overall boundary contour and the distribution of internal details in a more scientific manner. The study proposes a feasible method and path for the identification of urban clusters. It can serve as a starting point for formulating spatial planning policies for urban agglomerations, aiding in precise and scientific control of boundary growth. This can promote the rational allocation of resources and optimization of spatial structure by providing a reliable reference for the optimization of urban agglomeration space and the development of regional spatial policies.},

Some representative models and prediction approaches have been proposed for modeling and predicting human mobility. However, multi-source heterogeneous data from handheld terminals, GPS, and social media, provides a new driving force for exploring urban human mobility patterns from a quantitative and microscopic perspective. The studies of human mobility modeling and prediction play a vital role in a series of applications such as urban planning, epidemic control, location-based services, and intelligent transportation management. In this survey, we review human mobility models based on a human-centric angle in a datadriven context. Specifically, we characterize human mobility patterns from individual, collective, and hybrid levels. Meanwhile, we survey human mobility prediction methods from four aspects and then describe recent development respectively. Finally, we discuss some open issues that provide a helpful reference for researchers' future direction. This review not only lays a solid foundation for beginners who want to acquire a quick understanding of human mobility but also provides helpful information for researchers on how to develop a unified human mobility model.},

This paper investigates multicollinearity issues surrounding the local GWR coefficients at a single location and the overall correlation between GWR coefficients associated with two different exogenous variables. Results indicate that the local regression coefficients are potentially collinear even if the underlying exogenous variables in the data generating process are uncorrelated. Based on these findings, applied GWR research should practice caution in substantively interpreting the spatial patterns of local GWR coefficients. An empirical disease-mapping example is used to motivate the GWR multicollinearity problem. Controlled experiments are performed to systematically explore coefficient dependency issues in GWR. These experiments specify global models that use eigenvectors from a spatial link matrix as exogenous variables.},

  abstract = {There is an ongoing discussion about the impact of flexible forms of work on travel behavior. Though it is generally accepted that telework decreases distance commuted, there are mixed conclusions about the notion that non-work-related journeys could be offsetting any saved commute. This paper investigates the influence of two flexible working arrangements – namely telework and flextime – on commutes, non-work traffic, and peak-period travel in Switzerland. Using the 2015 Swiss Mobility and Transport Microcensus (MTMC), this study analyzes flexible working arrangements with respect to their effects on traffic. The results show that people who work partly from home – compared to those who never telework – do indeed commute less; however, their non-work travel increases. This rebound effect completely offsets the saved commutes, resulting in a zero impact on the total distances covered. Only people who work exclusively remotely show less total mobility compared to those who never telework. However, only a small minority of people work only from home, with most teleworkers combining working on-site with some degree of working from home. Moreover, this study finds only slight potential for relieving traffic congestion through flexible working arrangements: Whereas teleworkers are less likely to commute during evening peak periods, people working flextime are even more likely to commute during morning rush hours. Hence, the distinction between morning and evening peak periods should be taken into account in future studies. Furthermore, research on flexible working arrangements and travel behavior benefits from the consideration of both non-work travel and total travel as well as the separation of part-time from full-time telework.},

Datasets evaluated the flows come from various sources in different domains, e.g. mobile phone data, taxi trajectories data, metro/bus swiping data, bike-sharing data and so on. To summarize these methodologies of urban flows prediction, in this paper, we first introduce four main factors affecting urban flows. Second, in order to further analysis urban flows, a preparation process of multi-sources spatial-temporal data related with urban flows is partitioned into three groups. Third, we choose the spatial-temporal dynamic data as a case study for the urban flows prediction task. Fourth, we analyze and compare some well-known and state-of-the-art flows prediction methods in detail, classifying them into five categories: statistics-based, traditional machine learning-based, deep learning-based, reinforcement learning-based and transfer learning-based methods. Finally, we give open challenges of urban flows prediction and an outlook in the future of this field. This paper will facilitate researchers find suitable methods and open datasets for addressing urban spatial-temporal flows forecast problems.},

A new urban planning paradigm must be at the heart of our road map for the years to come, the one where, within minutes, inhabitants can access their basic living needs by bike or by foot. In this work, we present novel insights of the interplay between the distributions of facilities and population that maximize accessibility over the existing road networks. Results in six cities reveal that travel costs could be reduced in half through redistributing facilities. In the optimal scenario, the average travel distance can be modeled as a functional form of the number of facilities and the population density. As an application of this finding, it is possible to estimate the number of facilities needed for reaching a desired average travel distance given the population distribution in a city.},

  abstract = {A key issue to understand urban system is to characterize the activity dynamics in a city—when, where, what, and how activities happen in a city. To better understand the urban activity dynamics, city-wide and multiday activity participation sequence data, namely, activity chain as well as suitable spatiotemporal models, are needed. The commonly used household travel survey data in activity analysis suffers from limited sample size and temporal coverage. The emergence of large-scale spatiotemporal data in urban areas, such as mobile phone data, provides a new opportunity to infer urban activities and the underlying dynamics. However, the challenge is the absence of labeled activity information in mobile phone data. Consequently, how to fuse the useful information in household survey data and mobile phone data to build city-wide, multiday, and all-time activity chains becomes an important research question. Moreover, the multidimension structure of the activity data (e.g., location, start time, duration, type) makes the extraction of spatiotemporal activity patterns another difficult problem. In this study, the authors first introduce an activity chain inference model based on tensor decomposition to infer the missing activity labels in large-scale and multiday activity data, and then develop a spatiotemporal event clustering model based on DBSCAN, called STE-DBSCAN, to identify the spatiotemporal activity patterns. The proposed approaches achieved good accuracy and produced patterns with a high level of interpretability.},

Many current methods rely on parameters requiring calibration from empirical trip volumes. Their values are often not generalizable to cases without calibration data. To solve this problem we develop a statistical expression to calculate commuting trips with a quantitative functional form to estimate the model parameter when empirical trip data is not available. We calculate commuting trip volumes at scales from within a city to an entire country, introducing a scaling parameter α to the recently proposed parameter free radiation model. The model requires only widely available population and facility density distributions. The parameter can be interpreted as the influence of the region scale and the degree of heterogeneity in the facility distribution. We explore in detail the scaling limitations of this problem, namely under which conditions the proposed model can be applied without trip data for calibration. On the other hand, when empirical trip data is available, we show that the proposed model's estimation accuracy is as good as other existing models. We validated the model in different regions in the U.S., then successfully applied it in three different countries.},

Prior research has identified the ‘circular causality’ associated with the ontology of space syntax, indicating that network structure and functional attractors are mutually reinforced by movement patterns in urban spaces. Using the city of Xi’an as a case study, this research aims to deepen the understanding of urban form and human movement patterns from a new perspective that integrates the space syntax approach with multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). To quantify the city’s attractors and gauge their impacts on its urban form, this research uses available open urban datasets, including street networks from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Point of Interest (POI) data. Facilitated by sensitivity analysis (SA), the findings suggest that the functional distinctiveness of districts plays a nuanced role in attracting and generating pedestrian flow. It is therefore essential to introduce a ‘real-time’ representation of urban spaces to supplement our conventional understanding.}

With the development of mobile Internet and position technologies, it is reasonable to collect spatio-temporal data and then leverage these data to achieve the goal of intelligent transportation, and here, traffic prediction plays an important role. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on traffic prediction, which is from the spatio-temporal data layer to the intelligent transportation application layer. At first, we split the whole research scope into four parts from bottom to up, where the four parts are, respectively, spatio-temporal data, preprocessing, traffic prediction and traffic application. Later, we review existing work on the four parts. First, we summarize traffic data into five types according to their difference on spatial and temporal dimensions. Second, we focus on four significant data preprocessing techniques: map-matching, data cleaning, data storage and data compression. Third, we focus on three kinds of traffic prediction problems (i.e., classification, generation and estimation/forecasting). In particular, we summarize the challenges and discuss how existing methods address these challenges. Fourth, we list five typical traffic applications. Lastly, we provide emerging research challenges and opportunities. We believe that the survey can help the partitioners to understand existing traffic prediction problems and methods, which can further encourage them to solve their intelligent transportation applications.},

More specifically, we employ the framework of the residual neural networks to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of the crowd traffic, respectively. For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of the crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region. We evaluate ST-ResNet based on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and NYC, finding that its performance exceeds six well-know methods.},

  abstract = {An intra-urban hierarchy of activity centers interconnected by non-motorized and public transportation is broadly believed to be the ideal urban spatial structure for sustainable cities. However, the proper hinterland area for centers at each level lacks empirical study. Based on the concentric structure of everyday travel distances, working centers, shopping centers, and neighborhood centers are extracted from corresponding types of POIs in 286 Chinese cities at the prefectural level and above. A U-shaped curve between Household Transportation Energy Consumption (HTEC) per capita and center density at each of the three levels has been found through regression analysis. An optimal intra-urban hierarchy of activity centers is suggested to construct energy-efficient cities.},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporalactivity modeling is an important task for applications like tour recommendation and place search. The recently developed geographical topic models have demonstrated compelling results in using geo-tagged social media (GTSM) for spatiotemporal activity modeling. Nevertheless, they all operate in batch and cannot dynamically accommodate the latest information in the GTSM stream to reveal up-to-date spatiotemporal activities. We propose ReAct, a method that processes continuous GTSM streams and obtains recency-aware spatiotemporal activity models on the fly. Distinguished from existing topic-based methods, ReAct embeds all the regions, hours, and keywords into the same latent space to capture their correlations. To generate high-quality embeddings, it adopts a novel semi-supervised multimodal embedding paradigm that leverages the activity category information to guide the embedding process. Furthermore, as new records arrive continuously, it employs strategies to effectively incorporate the new information while preserving the knowledge encoded in previous embeddings. Our experiments on the geo-tagged tweet streams in two major cities have shown that ReAct significantly outperforms existing methods for location and activity retrieval tasks.},

  abstract = {The availability of large amounts of mobility data has stimulated the research in discovering patterns and understanding regularities. Comparatively, less attention has been paid to the study of variability, which, however, has been argued as equally important as regularities, since variability identifies diversity. In a transport network, variability exists from person to person, from place to place, and from day to day. In this paper, we present a set of measuring of variability at individual and aggregated levels using multi-day smart-card data. Statistical analysis, correlation matrix and network-based clustering methods are applied and potential use of measured results for urban applications are also discussed. We take Singapore as a case study and use one-week smart-card data for analysis. An interesting finding is that though the number of trips and mobility patterns varies from day to day, the overall spatial structure of urban movement always remains the same throughout a week. This finding showed that a systemic framework with well-organized analytical methods is indeed, necessary for extracting variability that may change at different levels and consequently for uncovering different aspects of dynamics, namely transit, social and urban dynamics. We consider this paper as a tentative work toward such generic framework for measuring variability and it can be used as a reference for other research work in such a direction.},

  abstract = {Identifying changes in the spatial structure of cities is a prerequisite for the development and validation of adequate planning strategies. Nevertheless, current methods of measurement are becoming ever more challenged by the highly diverse and intertwined ways of how people actually make use of urban space. Here, we propose a new quantitative measure for the centrality of locations, taking into account not only the numbers of people attracted to different locations, but also the diversity of the activities they are engaged in. This ‘centrality index’ allows for the identification of functional urban centres and for a systematic tracking of their relative importance over time, thus contributing to our understanding of polycentricity. We demonstrate the proposed index using travel survey data in Singapore for different years between 1997 and 2012. It is shown that, on the one hand, the city-state has been developing rapidly towards a polycentric urban form that compares rather closely with the official urban development plan. On the other hand, however, the downtown core has strongly gained in its importance, and this can be partly attributed to the recent extension of the public transit system.},

  abstract = {To discover regularities in human mobility is of fundamental importance to our understanding of urban dynamics, and essential to city and transport planning, urban management and policymaking. Previous research has revealed universal regularities at mainly aggregated spatio-temporal scales but when we zoom into finer scales, considerable heterogeneity and diversity is observed instead. The fundamental question we address in this paper is at what scales are the regularities we detect stable, explicable, and sustainable. This paper thus proposes a basic measure of variability to assess the stability of such regularities focusing mainly on changes over a range of temporal scales. We demonstrate this by comparing regularities in the urban mobility patterns in three world cities, namely London, Singapore and Beijing using one-week of smart-card data. The results show that variations in regularity scale as non-linear functions of the temporal resolution, which we measure over a scale from 1 minute to 24 hours thus reflecting the diurnal cycle of human mobility. A particularly dramatic increase in variability occurs up to the temporal scale of about 15 minutes in all three cities and this implies that limits exist when we look forward or backward with respect to making short-term predictions. The degree of regularity varies in fact from city to city with Beijing and Singapore showing higher regularity in comparison to London across all temporal scales. A detailed discussion is provided, which relates the analysis to various characteristics of the three cities. In summary, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of regularities in patterns of transit use from variations in volumes of travellers entering subway stations, it establishes a generic analytical framework for comparative studies using urban mobility data, and it provides key points for the management of variability by policy-makers intent on for making the travel experience more amenable.},
